# Liquor Cabinet

Back-End Code (Front-End Code available [here](https://github.com/maxjacobzander/liquor-cabinet-front-end))
## What's Is Liquor Cabinet?
Liquor Cabinet is a single-page web application with a React/Redux front-end and a Rails API backend. Users can search a type of liquor that they have in their posession and the app with return cocktail recipes that the user can make featuring that liquor.

### User Guide
Upon opening up the page, the user must confirm that they are of legal drinking age (in the USA). If so, they are taken to the home page where they can input a type of liquor into the search bar and have drinks returned to them. By hovering over a drink's card, the drink's recipe with be revealed. The user also has the option to either view all of the drinks in the database or add a new drink if it isn't already listed. If viewing the full list, users can also search the database by ingredient. Also, if they so choose, a user can click on the "View This Drink" button to see a recipe larger.

### Future Plans
Anticipated future updates include:
- The ability to edit drink entries
- The ability to rate drinks

### Installation Guide
- Clone both front-end and back-end repositories
